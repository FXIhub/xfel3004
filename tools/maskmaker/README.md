# Graphical Mask Maker for DSSC detector 
Based on CsPadMaskMaker.

This provides a geometry corrected view of the hexagonal pixels of the DSSC detector, each pixel is placed in x,y space then the surrounding area is 'filled' to provide an approximate representation of the hexagonal grid with a small number of pixels. 

## Installation
To install dependencies through conda, run:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml -n maskmaker
$ conda activate maskmaker
```

## Example
```
# python mask
